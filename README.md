# DevopsProject-1-Java


This was my first attempt at making a devops CI/CD pipeline. Forgive me if I do things in this report that would not be suitable for professional work environment or is just bad practice. I'm still learning and any feedback would be much appreciated. Devops requires a board understanding of computing, with many tools to learn and I'm trying my best to be as proficient as possible; so I can be an asset to my team. Future projects may show different ways of acheiving the same goal because not only different companies use different tools but also in the way they choose to execute and maintain their projects. I hope this goes well.

Tools included:
- Java - sample project is written in java
- Git - local version control system
- GitHub - distributed version control system
- Maven - java build tool
- Jenkins - continuous integration tool
- Ansible - configuration management under deployment
- Docker - containerization
- Kubernetes - container management
- AWS - cloud
